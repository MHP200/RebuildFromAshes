                  Welcome to Rebuild from Ashes Wildfires can wreak havoc, leaving families homeless and ravaging communities in their path. But from the ashes, hope emerges. At Rebuild from Ashes, we believe in the power of resilience and community to help those affected start anew. Rebuild from Ashes is a platform dedicated to those who have lost their homes to wildfires. We offer a space where victims can start campaigns to raise funds, share their stories, and connect with people ready to lend a helping hand. Furthermore, we will provide educational resources to teach the future generation the importance of stopping wildfires, how to prevent them, and the best way to stop them. By standing together, we can turn the devastation of wildfires into a chance for renewal and growth. Explore the site, start a campaign, or contribute to a cause. Together, let's rebuild from the ashes.

                <h2>The Process of Initial User Research</h2>
                <p>
                
                In the early stages of developing Rebuild from Ashes, we placed great importance on understanding the needs and perspectives of our users. This process, often referred to as the "Beginning Stages of User Exploration," involves several steps to ensure we built a platform that truly resonates with those it aims to serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                1. Identifying the User Base: Our primary user base consists of individuals and families affected by wildfires. We extended our focus to include community members, volunteers, and donors interested in helping the victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                2. Conducting Surveys and Interviews: We carried out extensive surveys and one-on-one interviews to gain firsthand insights into the needs, challenges, and preferences of our users. This helped us to identify the essential features and resources our platform should offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                3. Observation and Interaction Analysis: To understand user behavior and needs more profoundly, we conducted observational studies and interaction analyses. This involved studying how users interact with similar platforms and services, and identifying what works well and what can be improved.
                </p>
                <p>
                4. Analyzing Data and Drawing Insights: The data collected from surveys, interviews, and observation studies were systematically analyzed. Patterns and trends were identified, and from these, we drew meaningful insights to inform the design and functionality of Rebuild from Ashes.
                </p>
                <p>
                5. Iterative User Testing: Our user exploration didn't stop after the initial research. As we developed the platform, we continued to engage with users, seeking feedback on various design and functionality elements. This iterative process allowed us to refine and enhance the platform based on real user feedback.
                In essence, our user exploration process was rooted in empathy and a deep understanding of the people we serve. By engaging directly with our users, we've built a platform that truly supports those looking to rebuild their lives after the devastation of wildfires.
                </p>

                <h2>Initial Design</h2>
                <p>

                  In the initial stages of our software design, we made deliberate choices to ensure simplicity and ease of use. Our color palette consisted of baby blue, white, and green, creating a fresh and visually appealing look for our application.

                  To maintain a uniform and intuitive user interface, we placed great emphasis on clear and prominent buttons throughout the design. These buttons were strategically positioned in consistent locations across different pages, making them easily noticeable and accessible. The operations associated with each button were carefully chosen to cater to the needs and preferences of our users.
                  
                  While our initial design provided a solid foundation, we acknowledged the importance of user feedback in refining and expanding the application. We understood that incorporating diverse perspectives and additional pages would enhance the overall user experience and make our solution more appealing and effective.
                  
                  To address the needs of visually impaired individuals, we included an audio button feature. This feature aimed to assist users by providing audio instructions and directions to ensure a smooth setup process for the cane.
                  
                  By prioritizing simplicity and user-friendly design elements, along with incorporating user feedback, we aimed to create a software application that not only meets the functional requirements but also offers a visually pleasing and accessible experience for all users.

                <h2>Further research</h2>
                <p>
                Through our interview research method, we conducted interviews with individuals to gather data on their perspectives and experiences regarding the current wildfire situation in California. The interviews consisted of questions related to their thoughts on wildfires, the role of technology in predicting and responding to wildfires, their familiarity with state resources for wildfire victims, their personal experiences and needs in the event of a wildfire, their awareness of technology for donating and helping wildfire victims, and their opinions on an app that combines donation assistance with wildfire prevention advice.
                These questions and results consist of the following: 
                </p>                
                <p>1.	What do you think of the current wildfire situation in California? Response: "I don’t know much about wildfires in California. One thing I can notice is that there are a few every summer.</p>
                <p>2.	What is the role of technology in predicting and responding to wildfires in California? Response: "I feel that technology doesn’t have much of a role when predicting wildfires because I think that wildfires are human-made and it is hard to predict that."</p>
                <p>3.	Currently, California has state resources for wildfire victims. Are you familiar with them? If so, how have they helped you, and what could they do better? Response: "I am not familiar with any resources for wildfire victims."</p>
                <p>4.	Are you aware of any current technology that allows people to donate or help people affected by wildfires? If so, what do you think they could improve on? Response: "I know about GoFundMe. I think that people that have been affected by wildfires can request donations through GoFundMe. I think that the main issue with this is that the funds are not immediate, so often people affected have to wait until they receive donations."</p>
                <p>5.	What do you think about an app that allows you to donate/help people that have suffered from wildfires? It also gives advice to stop/avoid wildfires. Response: "I think the app sounds like a great idea. I think it would be nice if this company also keeps extra funds to help future victims so that when they need help, they can get help asap."
                These interview results provided valuable insights into the perspectives and needs of individuals regarding wildfires and related resources. From Jack Lei's interview, it is clear that there is a lack of awareness regarding state resources for wildfire victims, and the suggestion of having an app that facilitates donations and provides wildfire prevention advice was positively received.</p>






                <h2>Data Analysis</h2> 
                <p>
                  Based on the data collected from the interviews, it is evident that there is a range of opinions and experiences regarding wildfires in California. While some interviewees expressed limited knowledge about wildfires, others highlighted the need for better prediction and prevention measures. The interviews also revealed a lack of familiarity with existing state resources for wildfire victims, emphasizing the importance of raising awareness about available support. Furthermore, interviewees recognized the value of technology platforms like GoFundMe for donating to wildfire victims. However, the delay in receiving funds was seen as an area for improvement. The suggestion of an app that combines donation assistance with advice on preventing and avoiding wildfires was met with enthusiasm, indicating a potential opportunity for such an app to address multiple needs in a user-friendly manner. Overall, the interview data provided valuable insights for understanding the perspectives, needs, and potential areas for improvement related to wildfires and supporting those affected by them. These insights will guide the design and development process of a comprehensive app that addresses the identified needs and offers assistance to both wildfire victims and individuals seeking preventive measures.
                  </p><p>Our initial wireframes and usability tests had several limitations. The usability test had a sample size of 10, and most users were already aware of our project. This limits how well we can generalize our application for broad-scale use. Our product would have been catered around our own thoughts and what 10 people think. Also, during a wildfire network infrastructure may be down, limiting the capabilities of our app. Our software design would have to cater to offline usage. The addition of the audio button feature is nice, and perhaps we can expand more on making our app more disability accessible, such as with colors too. And as user preferences evolve, such as technological and logistical developments related to combating wildfires, we need to repeatedly iterate our application and conduct further usability tests, as using only one usability test only covers current user preferences.

                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p>In the future, we plan to enhance the design potential of the fire donation app by incorporating several key aspects based on our experience and learnings. Our primary focus will be expanding awareness and outreach. We understand the significance of raising awareness about the app and its purpose. To achieve this, we plan to implement effective marketing strategies, collaborate with relevant organizations, and leverage social media platforms to spread the word about the app's capabilities and the impact of donations.
                To keep users informed and engaged, we aim to incorporate real-time updates within the app. By integrating data on wildfire incidents, relief efforts, and the impact of donations, users will have access to up-to-date information, fostering transparency and trust.
                By implementing these future design strategies, we aim to create an even more effective, user-friendly, and impactful fire donation app. Our vision is to connect donors with wildfire victims, foster community support, and contribute to the prevention and mitigation of future wildfires.</p>
